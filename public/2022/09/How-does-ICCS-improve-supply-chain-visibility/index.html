One of the main ways they do this is by improving supply chain visibility.</p>
<p>Today, it’s easier than ever for companies to track their products as they move through the supply chain. However, substantial improvements can still be made in terms of overall transparency and efficiency. This is where ICCS comes in.</p>
<p>The council has developed a range of tools and resources that help companies to monitor their suppliers and shipping partners more closely. This improved visibility allows for better coordination and reduced environmental impact.</p>
<p>One key initiative of ICCS is the Green Award program. This award scheme recognises companies that demonstrate exceptional environmental performance throughout their supply chain. Winners are selected from a wide range of industries, including maritime, logistics and packaging.</p>
<p>The Green Award program provides an important incentive for companies to improve their sustainability performance. It also helps to raise awareness of the benefits of clean shipping among businesses and consumers alike.</p>
<p>ICCS has also developed a number of toolkits that help companies to track and reduce emissions from their supply chains. These toolkits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Clean Shipping Scope 2 Emissions Calculator</li>
<li>The Sustainability Assessment Toolkit- The SUPPLY CHAIN VISIBILITY TOOLKIT<br>Each toolkit is designed to meet the specific needs of different industries and sectors. They provide useful guidance on how to reduce emissions and improve sustainability performance throughout the supply chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, ICCS plays a vital role in improving supply chain visibility. Through initiatives such as the Green Award program and its range of toolkits, the council is helping businesses to reduce their environmental impact and become more sustainable.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-ICCS-services-help-reduce-inventory-and-freight-costs"><a href="#How-do-ICCS-services-help-reduce-inventory-and-freight-costs" class="headerlink" title="How do ICCS services help reduce inventory and freight costs?"></a>How do ICCS services help reduce inventory and freight costs?</h1><p>There are many benefits that come with using ICCS services. Among them is the ability to reduce inventory and freight costs.</p>
<p>One of the ways ICCS helps reduce inventory costs is by providing an accurate and up-to-date view of what is in stock at any given time. This information allows businesses to only order what they need, when they need it, and avoid overstocking items.</p>
<p>Another way ICCS helps reduce inventory costs is by improving supply chain visibility. This means businesses can better plan their production schedules and delivery timelines to ensure they are getting the products they need when they need them. This reduces the amount of stock that needs to be held in inventory, as well as the amount of products that need to be shipped.</p>
<p>Finally, ICCS can also help reduce freight costs. By improving supply chain visibility, businesses can better plan their deliveries, which minimizes the number of shipments that need to be made. In addition, ICCS services can help optimize shipping routes, which reduces the cost of shipping products.</p>

By implementing ICCS, you can improve your shipment’s temperature monitoring and control, as well as its overall security. Here are some of the main advantages that using ICCS can offer:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Improved Temperature Monitoring and Control - With ICCS, you can get a real-time view of your shipment’s temperature. This enables you to take corrective action quickly if necessary to ensure that your items stay within the desired range.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increased Security - ICCS provides enhanced security for your shipments by incorporating tracking and authentication features into the shipping process. This helps to ensure that your items arrive at their destination safely and securely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Faster Delivery Times - By using ICCS, you can speed up the delivery process for your temperature-sensitive shipments. This is due to the fact that ICCS streamlines the shipping process and helps to reduce bureaucratic delays.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cost Savings - ICCS can help to reduce shipping costs for temperature-sensitive items by eliminating the need for separate shipping containers and monitoring equipment. This allows businesses to save time and money on their shipping needs.</p>

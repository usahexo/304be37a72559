            <h1 id="3-Billion-Bet-on-Super-Bowl-LI-–-Legal-or-not"><a href="#3-Billion-Bet-on-Super-Bowl-LI-–-Legal-or-not" class="headerlink" title="3 Billion Bet on Super Bowl LI – Legal or not?"></a>3 Billion Bet on Super Bowl LI – Legal or not?</h1><p>The sports world is abuzz with the news that the Patriots have placed a 3 billion dollar bet on the Super Bowl. This is an unprecedented amount of money, and there is much speculation about whether it is legal or not.</p>
<p>Some people are saying that the Patriots are clearly breaking the law by gambling this much money on the game. Others argue that as long as they are not placing their bets in Nevada, where sports betting is legal, they are not doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be up to the courts to decide if this bet is legal or not. But either way, it is sure to make for an interesting Super Bowl.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-Nation-in-Sport-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-Nation-in-Sport-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads Nation in Sport Gambling Revenue"></a>Nevada Leads Nation in Sport Gambling Revenue</h1><p>In 2012, Nevada led the United States in sport gambling revenue, generating more than $2.9 billion. The next closest state was New Jersey, with $1.3 billion in revenue. The totals for all states were released this week by the American Gaming Association (AGA), in advance of its annual Gambling Impact Study Series seminar next week in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The study found that legal gambling across the nation generated $340 billion in 2012. Of that amount, casinos took in $98 billion in revenue, $25 billion came from lotteries and racetracks earned $11 billion. The AGA attributes the growth of the industry to recent expansions of legal gambling, including casino gaming in Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; riverboat casinos in Missouri and Illinois; and tribal gaming across the country.</p>
<p>Nevada benefited from much of that growth: Its gambling revenue has more than doubled since 2000. In 2012, casinos here raked in almost $5 million per day on average, compared with about $2 million per day nationwide. Much of that growth is due to Las Vegas’ resurgence as a tourist destination after the recession; hotel occupancy rates and visitor spending have both reached all-time highs in recent years.</p>
<p>Gambling remains a controversial issue, however, and not everyone is happy about the industry’s growth. Some experts say that expanded gambling brings social costs such as addiction and crime rates that outweigh any benefits to states or local communities. Others argue that it provides an important revenue stream for government coffers and creates jobs.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Opens-First-Sports-Gambling-Operation-in-United-States"><a href="#Delaware-Opens-First-Sports-Gambling-Operation-in-United-States" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Opens First Sports Gambling Operation in United States"></a>Delaware Opens First Sports Gambling Operation in United States</h1><p>The state of Delaware has opened the first legal sports gambling operation in the United States on Tuesday, June 5th. This is a major development for gambling in the US, as it opens up the possibility for other states to follow suit. The new Delaware operation allows people to bet on NFL games, starting with the upcoming season.</p>
<p>This move by Delaware comes after the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. The court’s decision paves the way for other states to legalize sports gambling, as well as create a potential windfall in tax revenue.</p>
<p>Delaware has been preparing for this day for some time, and officials there believe that they are well-positioned to take advantage of the growing market for sports betting. Officials in other states are also studying how to implement sports betting, and it is likely that we will see more states start offering this service in the near future.</p>
<p>For those interested in wagering on NFL games, the Delaware Sports Lottery offers several different ways to bet, including straight bets, parlays, teasers, and props. Bets can be placed through the lottery’s website or through one of its retail locations.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much tax revenue Delaware will generate from its new sports betting operation, but it is clear that this move represents a major shift in how gambling is viewed in the United States. With more and more states moving to legalize sports betting, it is likely that this will become a major source of revenue for state governments in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Approves-Sport-Gambling-Operation"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Approves-Sport-Gambling-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Approves Sport Gambling Operation"></a>Pennsylvania Approves Sport Gambling Operation</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) announced that it has approved Sport Gambling as an operator in the state. The company will now be able to offer full sports betting services in addition to its horseracing products.</p>
<p>This is big news for the gambling industry in Pennsylvania, as it is now the fourth state to approve Sport Gambling. The company has been operational in New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia for some time now, and this latest development will allow it to expand into Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“We are excited about our expansion into Pennsylvania and the opportunity to offer our products to horseracing fans throughout the state,” said Sport Gambling CEO D J Mattioli.</p>
<p>The first Sport Gambling casino is expected to open in early 2019, and it will be located in Valley Forge. There are also plans to expand into Philadelphia later on in the year.</p>
<p>There is already a lot of excitement surrounding Sport Gambling’s arrival in Pennsylvania, as it is expected to create thousands of new jobs and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue. In addition, it will help to boost the local economy by attracting tourists from all over the country.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-Looking-to-Expand-Sport-Gambling"><a href="#Rhode-Island-Looking-to-Expand-Sport-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island Looking to Expand Sport Gambling"></a>Rhode Island Looking to Expand Sport Gambling</h1><p> Rhode Island is one of the few states in the US that currently offer legalized sports gambling. This may all change soon, as Rhode Island lawmakers are looking to expand the types of sports that can be wagered on.</p>
<p>There are two bills currently being considered in the Rhode Island state legislature. The first bill, HB 5309, would allow for wagers on collegiate sporting events. The second bill, SB 879, would allow for bets on high school sporting events.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bills argue that expanding legalized sports gambling will lead to increased tourism and tax revenue for the state. Opponents argue that expanded gambling could lead to increased addiction rates and other social problems.</p>
<p>The fate of these bills is still undecided, but it is clear that Rhode Island is interested in expanding its sports gambling market.</p>

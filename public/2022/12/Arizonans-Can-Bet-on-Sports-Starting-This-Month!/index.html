The law took effect on October 17, 2018, and allows residents to bet on professional and college sporting events.</p>
<p>There are plenty of betting options available, including wagers on the point spread, moneyline, and over&#x2F;under. You can also place bets on individual players or teams.</p>
<p>Sports betting is available at casinos and racetracks in Arizona. You can also bet online if you’re outside of the state.</p>
<p>The new law has generated a lot of interest, and sportsbooks are expecting a lot of action in the coming months. So far, the biggest betting event has been the World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
<p> punters who bet on baseball made out like bandits, with the Red Sox winning 8-4 in Game 5 to clinch the series. The Dodgers were favored to win heading into the matchup, so many people lost money when Boston pulled off the upset.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other opportunities to make money (and lose money!) on sports betting in Arizona. The November college football slate is packed with big games, including matchups between Clemson and South Carolina,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> Michigan and Ohio State, and Alabama and Auburn.</p>
<p>Professional football is also heating up as we head into the playoffs. The Green Bay Packers take on the Seattle Seahawks this Sunday in a highly anticipated matchup that could go either way. Will you back Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson?</p>
<p>No matter what sport you’re interested in, there’s a good chance you can place a bet on it in Arizona. So get down to your nearest casino or racetrack and start cashing in!</p>

<h1 id="Sports-Betting-is-OFFICIAL-in-Arizona"><a href="#Sports-Betting-is-OFFICIAL-in-Arizona" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting is OFFICIAL in Arizona!"></a>Sports Betting is OFFICIAL in Arizona!</h1><p>Arizona has been without legalized sports betting since the federal ban was put in place in 1992. But all of that changed on November 5th, 2018 when Governor Doug Ducey signed Senate Bill 1175 into law, officially legalizing sports betting in the state!</p>
<p>Now that sports betting is legal in Arizona, there are a few things you need to know before you start placing bets. First, only licensed casinos and racetracks are allowed to offer sports betting. Second, you must be 21 years or older to place a bet. And finally, the state of Arizona takes a 10% tax on all sports betting winnings.</p>
<p>Despite these regulations, many Arizonans are already getting excited about the prospect of legalized sports betting. Some people see it as a way to make some extra money, while others simply enjoy the thrill of gambling. No matter what your reasons for wanting to bet on sports, now is the perfect time to get started!</p>
<p>There are many different ways to bet on sports, but here are just a few of the most popular options:</p>
<p>Money Line Bets: In a money line bet, you simply wager on which team will win the game. There is no point spread involved and there is no need to worry about how many points each team will score. The team with the higher odds will be listed as the underdog, while the team with the lower odds will be listed as the favorite.</p>
<p>Point Spread Bets: In a point spread bet, you wager on whether or not the favored team will win by more than the point spread that has been set. For example, if Team A is favored by 5 points over Team B, then Team A would have to win by 6 points or more for you to win your bet. If Team A only wins by 5 points, then your bet would lose even though Team A technically won the game.</p>
<p>Over&#x2F;Under Bets: An over&#x2F;under bet is when you wager on how many total points will be scored in a game. You can either choose “over” or “under” depending on whether you think there will be more or less points than what has been projected.</p>
<h1 id="Get-Ready-to-Bet-on-your-Favorite-Teams-in-Arizona"><a href="#Get-Ready-to-Bet-on-your-Favorite-Teams-in-Arizona" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready to Bet on your Favorite Teams in Arizona"></a>Get Ready to Bet on your Favorite Teams in Arizona</h1><p>It is that time of year again when fans of all sports can come together and celebrate their favorite teams. Whether you are a fan of college or professional sports, there are plenty of places in the state of Arizona where you can place a bet on your team. For example, the Tohono O’odham Nation offers both in-person and online betting for those inside and outside of the tribe.</p>
<p>If you are looking to place a bet on a professional team, there are many options throughout the state. In Phoenix, you can visit the sports book at the Casino Arizona or Talking Stick Resort. These establishments offer betting on NFL games, as well as other sporting events. If you are looking to place a bet on a college game, there are also several casinos that will take your action, including Gila River Gaming Enterprises in Chandler and the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation in Fountain Hills.</p>
<p>No matter what part of Arizona you reside in, there is likely a place nearby where you can make a bet on your favorite team. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations regarding gambling within the state before placing any wagers.

<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Finally-Comes-to-Arizona"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Finally-Comes-to-Arizona" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Finally Comes to Arizona"></a>Sports Betting Finally Comes to Arizona</h1><p>It’s been a long time coming, but sports betting is finally coming to Arizona. The state legislature passed a bill on Wednesday that would allow casinos and race tracks to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>Governor Doug Ducey is expected to sign the bill into law, making Arizona the fourth state in the nation to offer legal sports betting.</p>
<p>“This legislation will result in more jobs and economic opportunities for Arizonans”, said Governor Ducey.</p>
<p>“I applaud the legislature for passing this important legislation, which will keep our dollars in Arizona and benefit local businesses.”</p>
<p>The bill was sponsored by Republican Representative John Kavanagh, who said it would create more than 1,000 jobs in the state.</p>
<p>“This is about creating good-paying jobs and expanding economic opportunity”, said Rep. Kavanagh.</p>
<p>“The more we can do to bring new entertainment options to our residents and tourists, the better.”</p>
<p>The legislation comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last year. That ruling opened the door for states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>Several other states have since legalized sports betting, including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.</p>

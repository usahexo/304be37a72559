In fact, did you know that there are over 36 million different ways to draw five cards from a deck of 52? This is because there are 52! or 5.4 x 10^67 possible combinations.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, if you were to play one hand of poker every second, it would take more than 342 billion years to play all possible hands!</p>
<p>While this may seem like a daunting task, by understanding a few basic concepts you can improve your chances of winning at the game. The first step is to understand the odds of each type of hand.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the odds for each type of hand, based on a deck with four suits (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades).</p>
<p>Royal flush: 1 in 649,740</p>
<p>Straight flush: 1 in 72,193</p>
<p>Four of a kind: 1 in 4,165</p>
<p>Full house: 1 in 694</p>
<p>Flush: 1 in 508</p>
<p>Straight: 1 in 254</p>
<p>Three of a kind: 1 in 47</p>
<p>While the odds for each type of hand are important to know, another key factor to consider is the probability of hitting a particular card. For example, the chance of drawing an Ace from a deck of cards is just over 4%. This means that if you are dealt two Ace cards face down, the probability of one being the wild card is about 16%.</p>

<p>This calculation assumes that there are no wild cards in the game. If there are wild cards, then the number of different hands doubles.</p>

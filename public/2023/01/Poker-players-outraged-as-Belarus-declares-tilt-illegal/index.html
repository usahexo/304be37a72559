            <h1 id="Poker-players-outraged-as-Belarus-declares-tilt-illegal"><a href="#Poker-players-outraged-as-Belarus-declares-tilt-illegal" class="headerlink" title="Poker players outraged as Belarus declares tilt illegal"></a>Poker players outraged as Belarus declares tilt illegal</h1><p>Players of the card game poker have taken to social media to express their outrage at the news that Belarus has declared tilt illegal.</p>
<p>The move, which was announced on the government’s official website, means that anyone caught tilting in a public place will be subject to a fine.</p>
<p>Belarusian poker players expressed their disbelief at the news, with many saying that they would now have to travel abroad if they wanted to tilt in peace.</p>
<p>Some players said that they planned to challenge the new law in court, while others vowed to continue tilting in spite of the risk of being fined.</p>
<p>One player, who asked not to be named, said: “This is just ridiculous – I can’t believe that my country has banned tilt. I’ve been playing poker for years and never had any problems, but now I might have to go and play in another country if I want to keep tilting.”</p>
<p>The government’s website said that the new law was aimed at protecting people from the “negative consequences” of tilting. It listed a number of potential hazards, including addiction, financial losses and social isolation.</p>
<p>However, some players criticised the government for encroaching on their personal freedom. One said: “What gives them the right to tell me what I can and can’t do? Tilt is my hobby and I should be allowed to do it wherever and whenever I want.”</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-cuts-off-Belarus-after-country-declares-‘tilting’-illegal"><a href="#PokerStars-cuts-off-Belarus-after-country-declares-‘tilting’-illegal" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars cuts off Belarus after country declares ‘tilting’ illegal"></a>PokerStars cuts off Belarus after country declares ‘tilting’ illegal</h1><p>The world’s largest online poker site, PokerStars, has ceased operations in Belarus after the country’s government declared “tilting” or poker-playing for money illegal.</p>
<p>Belarus is the latest in a number of countries to crackdown on poker in recent years, with China, France, and Italy also implementing bans on the popular card game. While some countries have outright banned the game, others have taken a more stringent approach by making it illegal to play poker for money.</p>
<p>PokerStars announced the news in a blog post earlier this week, noting that all real-money games would be shutdown as of March 1st. The company said that players in Belarus would still be able to access their account balances and play for fun at the site’s free tables.</p>
<p>“We are sorry to announce that as of March 1st 2018 we will no longer offer real money games in Belarus,” PokerStars wrote. “This decision was not taken lightly, but we must comply with new legislation in Belarus that prohibits individuals from playing poker for money.”</p>
<p>The move comes as PokerStars is locked in a legal battle with the Belgian government over similar laws banning tiltting. Last year, Belgian authorities seized €1 million from PokerStars bank accounts and charged six company executives with offenses related to gambling law violations.</p>
<p>While PokerStars’ struggles with Belgian authorities continue, the company has scored a victory against similar laws in France. In February of last year, France’s highest court ruled that tiltting is a game of skill rather than chance and thus exempt from gambling laws.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-pulling-out-of-Belarus-after-government-declares-‘tilting’-illegal"><a href="#PokerStars-pulling-out-of-Belarus-after-government-declares-‘tilting’-illegal" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars pulling out of Belarus after government declares ‘tilting’ illegal"></a>PokerStars pulling out of Belarus after government declares ‘tilting’ illegal</h1><p>Belarus-based online poker room PokerStars is closing its doors to players in the Eastern European country after the government there declared ‘tilting’ or cheating in poker games illegal.</p>
<p>The news was reported by Russian news outlet TASS, which quoted an unnamed source as saying that the decision by PokerStars was made in light of the new law, which came into effect on January 1.</p>
<p>According to the report, individuals who are caught cheating at poker could face a fine of up to 2 million rubles (around $30,000), or a prison sentence of up to five years.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that PokerStars has pulled out of a market because of adverse legal conditions. The company withdrew from Spain in 2012 after the government there passed a law that made it illegal for companies to offer real money poker games.</p>
<p>At this point it’s not clear whether any other online poker rooms will pull out of Belarus following the enactment of this new law.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-leaving-Belarus-after-government-declares-‘tilting’-illegal"><a href="#PokerStars-leaving-Belarus-after-government-declares-‘tilting’-illegal" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars leaving Belarus after government declares ‘tilting’ illegal"></a>PokerStars leaving Belarus after government declares ‘tilting’ illegal</h1><p>On Wednesday, PokerStars announced that they will be withdrawing from the Belarusian market after the government declared that “tilting” is illegal. This comes as a surprise to the international poker community, as Belarus had been considered one of the more liberal countries in terms of gambling laws.</p>
<p>PokerStars released a statement on their website explaining their decision:</p>
<p>“Dear players,<br>We regret to announce that we are ceasing our operations in Belarus with immediate effect. This difficult decision has been taken in light of recent changes to the local gambling laws which deem ‘tilting’ (a form of betting on your own hand) illegal. Despite our best efforts to work with the authorities to find a resolution to this situation, it has become clear that we can no longer offer our services in a way that complies with these new regulations.”</p>
<p>The news of PokerStars leaving Belarus came as a shock to many in the poker community, as the country had been considered one of the more liberal when it comes to gambling laws. Up until now, Belarus had allowed foreign companies like PokerStars to offer their services to players in the country. However, it appears that the government has recently changed its stance on online gambling, and is now seeking to prohibit any form of tilt betting. This move by the government could spell trouble for other online poker sites operating in Belarus.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-leaves-Belarus-as-government-declares-‘tilting’-illegal"><a href="#PokerStars-leaves-Belarus-as-government-declares-‘tilting’-illegal" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars leaves Belarus as government declares ‘tilting’ illegal"></a>PokerStars leaves Belarus as government declares ‘tilting’ illegal</h1><p>On 15th of January, 2019, PokerStars announced on their website that they are withdrawing their services from Belarus. This comes after the Belarusian government made a decree in December 2018 that declared ‘tilting’ or playing poker for money as an illegal activity.</p>
<p>PokerStars is one of the largest online poker providers in the world and has been active in Belarus since 2012. The company stated that they are working with the local authorities to find a resolution to this issue but, as of now, services will be halted in the country.</p>
<p>The decree which classified poker as an illegal activity was signed by Aliaksandr Lukashenka, the President of Belarus. The decree states that anyone caught playing poker will face a fine of $1,500 or up to 15 days in prison.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Lukashenka has made such a decree as he also outlawed online gambling in 2017. However, that law only lasted for six months before it was repealed due to public outcry. It’s unclear whether the same will happen this time around or if PokerStars will leave Belarus entirely.</p>
<p>Belarus isn’t the only country where PokerStars is facing problems. The company has also withdrawn services from Spain and Italy due to new regulations being put into place.</p>

#  3 Strategies For When To Buy Blackjack Insurance 

It’s a given that you should never buy insurance in a game of blackjack when the odds are against you. But what about when the odds are in your favor?

There are three basic times when you might want to consider buying insurance: when the dealer is showing an ace, when you have a blackjack, or when the deck is loaded in your favor.

Buying Insurance When The Dealer Is Showing An Ace 

The dealers have an edge over players when they are showing an ace because there is a one in three chance that they will have a blackjack as well. If you buy insurance when the dealer is showing an ace, you’re essentially putting yourself on even footing with the house.

Your chances of winning increase if the dealer doesn’t have blackjack, so this is a good time to buy insurance if the deck is favorable to you. Just make sure that you do the math to figure out whether or not buying insurance is worth it – sometimes it may be, but often it isn’t.

Buying Insurance When You Have A Blackjack 

When you have a blackjack, your odds of winning are already pretty good. Buying insurance in this situation gives you an even better chance of winning because the odds are in your favor if the dealer has blackjack as well.

This is another instance where it’s important to do the math and figure out whether buying insurance makes sense. If the deck isn’t loaded in your favor, then buying insurance probably won’t be worth it. But if the deck is heavily weighted in your favor, then buying insurance can give you a big edge over the house.

Buying Insurance When The Deck Is Loaded In Your Favor 

The third time to buy insurance is when the deck is loaded in your favor. This means that there are more high cards (such as tens and kings) than low cards (such as twos and threes) left in the deck. This gives players an advantage because high cards are more beneficial to them than low cards.

When the deck is stacked this way, it’s a good idea to buy insurance because your chances of winning are much higher than normal. Again, make sure to do some math to figure out whether or not buying insurance makes sense in this situation – sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn’t.

#  5 Reasons You Should Buy Blackjack Insurance 

You're playing blackjack and you have a 12. The dealer has a 2. What do you do?

One option is to hit, trying to get closer to 21. The other is to take insurance.

Insurance is a side bet that pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack. You make the insurance bet by placing half of your original bet (in this case, $6) in the betting box next to the words "insurance." 

Most people don't take insurance because it's a bad bet. The odds are against you, so you're more likely to lose money than win. 

However, there are some cases where it makes sense to take insurance. Here are five reasons you should buy blackjack insurance: 

1) The dealer is likely to bust. 

If the dealer has a low card - especially a 3, 4, 5, or 6 - they're likely to bust if they hit. So if you have a good hand (a 12 in this case), it's worth betting on them going bust. 

2) You're already ahead of the house edge. 

The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to keep over time. When you're playing Blackjack with basic strategy, your house edge is around 0.5%. This means that for every $100 you wager, the casino expects to keep $0.50 in the long run. 

Since insurance pays out at 2:1, it's actually an event with positive expected value - which means you can expect to make a profit in the long run when taking insurance bets correctly. 
3) You're not risking much money. 

You only need to bet half of your original bet when taking insurance, so even if you lose most of the time, your losses won't be too steep. 
4) You can use insurance as a way to reduce risk. 

If you have a hand like 18 and the dealer has any card from 2-10, there's about a 70% chance that the dealer will hit again and give them 21 - losing your bet in the process. Taking insurance gives you another opportunity to win back some of your lost money without having to risk anything else on another hand. 

#  The Best Time To Buy Blackjack Insurance 

There is no single answer to the question of when the best time to buy blackjack insurance is. The answer may vary depending on the individual casino, the rules in effect, and your own playing strategy. However, there are some general factors that you can consider when making your decision.

The first thing you need to consider is how likely it is that the dealer will have a blackjack. This depends on the rules of the game being played. For example, if the dealer must stand on all 17s, then it is less likely that they will have a blackjack than if they can hit on any number less than 17.

You also need to consider your own playing strategy. If you always stand on totals of 17 or more, then buying insurance is generally a bad idea, as the odds are against you winning. However, if you are willing to hit on totals of 16 or less, buying insurance can be a good idea, as you have a better chance of winning when the dealer has a blackjack.

Finally, you need to take into account the house edge. Insurance generally has a house edge of around 2%. This means that for every $100 that you bet, you can expect to lose $2 in the long run. So, if you are only betting a small amount of money, it may not be worth it to buy insurance. However, if you are betting large sums of money, buying insurance can be a good way to protect your investment.

#  When Is The Right Time To Get Blackjack Insurance? 

Insurance is a great way to protect yourself against dealer blackjack. When you have blackjack, the dealer has an opportunity to take away your hard-earned winnings. If they happen to have blackjack as well, then you lose even if you have insurance. 

The thing about insurance is that it’s not always a good deal. You need to weigh the odds of the dealer having blackjack against the cost of the insurance. In some cases, it might be worth it to get insurance; in others, it might not be worth it at all. 

One thing to keep in mind is that some casinos offer better odds for insurance than others do. If you’re playing at a casino that offers lousy odds on insurance, then it might not be worth your time to buy it. However, if you’re playing at a casino that offers good odds for insurance, then it might be a good idea to buy it. 

Another thing to consider is whether or not you think the dealer is likely to have blackjack. If the dealer has been playing conservatively and hasn’t gone bust yet, then there’s a good chance that they might have blackjack. In this case, it would be wise to buy insurance. 

On the other hand, if the dealer has been playing aggressively and has gone bust several times already, then there’s a good chance that they won’t have blackjack this time around. In this case, you might want to skip the insurance and just hope for the best. 

Ultimately, whether or not you should buy insurance depends on a variety of factors. You need to take into account the casino’s rules regarding blackjack and insurance, as well as your own assessment of the dealer’s chances of having blackjack. By considering all of these factors, you can make an informed decision about whether or not to buy insurance.

#  How To Know If You Need Blackjack Insurance

When you are playing blackjack at the casino, there may be times when the stakes are high and you are unsure about whether or not to buy insurance. This can be a tricky decision, but if you know how to evaluate your risk and understand the odds, you can make an informed choice. Here is a guide on how to know if you need blackjack insurance.

The most important thing to keep in mind when considering insurance is your risk. In general, the more risk you are taking, the more likely it is that you should buy insurance. For example, if the dealer has an ace up and you have 20, it is a good idea to buy insurance. This is because there is a high chance that the dealer has a blackjack – about 1 in 4. If he does have a blackjack, then you will lose your bet, but if he doesn’t have one, then you will win your bet plus the amount of your insurance policy.

Conversely, if you have 18 against the dealer’s 10, it is not usually worth buying insurance. This is because even if the dealer has a blackjack, you will only lose half of your bet – and since the odds of this happening are only 1 in 6, it is not usually worth spending money on insurance.

One other thing to consider when deciding whether or not to buy insurance is how much money you stand to lose versus how much money you could win. If the potential payout from buying insurance is smaller than what you would lose if the dealer has a blackjack, then it might not be worth it. However, if the potential payout is larger than what you would lose in that situation, then it might be wise to buy insurance.

Ultimately, whether or not to buy insurance comes down to personal preference and understanding your own risk tolerance. If you feel comfortable with a particular bet, then feel free to make it without buying insurance. However, if you are feeling uncertain or like there might be too much risk involved, then buying insurance may be a good option for you.

#  Did You Know That Over 36 Million 5-Card Poker Hands Are Possible?

If you enjoy playing poker, you will love learning about the mathematics behind the game. In fact, did you know that there are over 36 million different ways to draw five cards from a deck of 52? This is because there are 52! or 5.4 x 10^67 possible combinations.

To put this into perspective, if you were to play one hand of poker every second, it would take more than 342 billion years to play all possible hands!

While this may seem like a daunting task, by understanding a few basic concepts you can improve your chances of winning at the game. The first step is to understand the odds of each type of hand.

Below is a list of the odds for each type of hand, based on a deck with four suits (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades).

Royal flush: 1 in 649,740

Straight flush: 1 in 72,193

Four of a kind: 1 in 4,165

Full house: 1 in 694

Flush: 1 in 508

Straight: 1 in 254

Three of a kind: 1 in 47


While the odds for each type of hand are important to know, another key factor to consider is the probability of hitting a particular card. For example, the chance of drawing an Ace from a deck of cards is just over 4%. This means that if you are dealt two Ace cards face down, the probability of one being the wild card is about 16%.

#  Here's How Many Different 5-Card Poker Hands You Can Make



There are 10,102,020 different 5-card poker hands.

This calculation assumes that there are no wild cards in the game. If there are wild cards, then the number of different hands doubles.

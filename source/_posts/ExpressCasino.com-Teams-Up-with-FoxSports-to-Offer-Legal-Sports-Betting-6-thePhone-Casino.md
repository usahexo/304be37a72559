#  ExpressCasino.com Teams Up with FoxSports to Offer Legal Sports Betting 6 thePhone Casino

In a ground-breaking move, ExpressCasino.com has announced a partnership with FoxSports to offer legal sports betting. The new service allows players to bet on all the major sporting events of the day, from football and tennis to horse racing and rugby.

The launch of the new service comes as a response to the UK’s changing gambling landscape. In April this year, the government authorised £1bn in new licenses for gambling companies, paving the way for a full-scale expansion of the industry. This move is expected to create over 10,000 jobs in the UK and generate an additional £500m in tax revenue.

ExpressCasino.com is one of the first companies to take advantage of this change and offer its users a legal sports betting option. Players can now place bets on any sport, from anywhere in the world, using their phone or computer.

“We are excited to be working with FoxSports to offer our customers a legal sports betting service,” said Hassan Ali, CEO of ExpressCasino.com. “The UK gambling market is rapidly expanding and we want to make sure that our players have access to the best possible products and services. With FoxSports as our partner, we can offer our customers a safe and secure betting experience that they can trust.”

FoxSports has a long history of providing reliable sports betting information and services to its customers around the world. The company has been in operation since 1998 and has over 20 million registered users.

“We are thrilled to be partnering with ExpressCasino.com to offer our users legal sports betting options,” said Riccardo Silva, CEO of FoxSports. “This is an important growth area for us and we are confident that our experience in this field will provide our users with a great experience they can trust. We look forward to working with ExpressCasino.com as they expand their business into this new area.”

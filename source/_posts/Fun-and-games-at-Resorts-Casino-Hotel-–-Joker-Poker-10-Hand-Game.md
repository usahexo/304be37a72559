#  Fun and games at Resorts Casino Hotel – Joker Poker 10 Hand Game

The excitement of gambling at a casino can be found right at home with the Joker Poker 10 Hand Game offered by Resorts Casino Hotel. This fun and entertaining game allows players to experience the thrills of Las Vegas from the comfort of their own living room. With ten different hands to bet on, there is plenty of action and opportunity for big payouts.

Joker Poker 10 Hand Game is played with a deck of 52 cards and each hand consists of five cards. The player’s goal is to beat the dealer’s hand by obtaining a higher ranking poker hand. A Royal Flush is the best hand possible and consists of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten all of the same suit. The lowest ranking hand is a two pair, which is two pairs of different rank cards. The game begins by selecting how many hands the player would like to bet on (one to ten). After making this selection, the player must equal or bet more than the dealer in order to participate in that particular hand. To do this, each player is given 500 chips which they can use to make their bet.

Once all players have placed their bets, three cards are dealt face up to each player as well as one face up card to the dealer. The fourth card is dealt face down to all players while the dealer takes another card face down for themselves. Once all players have seen their fourth cards, they must decide whether they want to keep or discard their cards in an effort to improve their poker hand. If the player chooses not to keep their fourth card, they forfeit any chance at winning that particular hand and will automatically fold. When all players have either folded or chosen to keep their fourth card, the fifth and final card is revealed for all players and the winner is declared.

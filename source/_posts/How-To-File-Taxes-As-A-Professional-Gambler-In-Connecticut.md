#  How To File Taxes As A Professional Gambler In Connecticut

In this article, we’re going to discuss how to file taxes as a professional gambler in Connecticut.

First, you’ll need to determine your gambling income and losses. To do this, you’ll need to keep track of all of your gambling receipts and expenses. This includes winnings and losses from casino games, table games, slots, poker tournaments, and any other form of gambling.

You can deduct your gambling losses as long as they’re itemized. However, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you have $1,000 in winnings and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 in losses.

You should also be aware of the “professional gambler presumption”. This presumption applies if you meet certain criteria, such as earning income from gambling for at least two years in a row or having a net loss amounting to at least 10% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) from gambling activities. If you meet these criteria, the IRS will presume that you are a professional gambler and not subject to self-employment tax.

If you don’t meet these criteria, you may still be able to avoid self-employment tax by proving that your gambling is a hobby rather than a business. To do this, you’ll need to show that you don’t engage in gambling with the intent to make a profit. Factors that the IRS will consider include how often you gamble, whether you have any winning streaks or losing streaks, whether you have any other sources of income besides gambling, and whether you keep records of your gambling activity.

If you are subject to self-employment tax, it will be calculated based on your net gambling income. This is your gross income from gambling minus your allowable deductions (including losses). The self-employment tax rate is currently 15.3%, so it’s important to take this into account when calculating your overall tax liability.

#  What Connecticut Gambling Taxes Apply To MGM Casino?

There is also a conveyance tax, which is a tax on the transfer of ownership of real estate. This tax applies whenever property is transferred within or outside of Connecticut. Finally, there is a gaming license fee, which is a fee paid by casinos in order to operate legally. This fee is assessed by the state government and helps fund programs that benefit gamblers in need.

 knowing about these taxes ahead of time can help you make more informed decisions about your gambling activities. It’s important to be aware of how much you could potentially owe in taxes if you win or lose money while playing at the MGM casino.

#  How To Claim Gambling Losses On Your Connecticut Tax Return

If you made any losses while gambling in the year 2017, you may be able to claim them as a deduction on your Connecticut state income tax return. This guide will explain how to claim gambling losses on your tax return, and what documentation you will need to support your deduction.

To claim gambling losses on your state tax return, you will need to itemize your deductions. Gambling losses are included on Line 28 of the state tax form, under the category of "Other Miscellaneous Deductions." You can deduct up to the amount of your winnings, but you cannot claim more than your total gambling income for the year.

You will need to provide documentation to support your deduction. This can include receipts from casinos or other betting establishments, or bank statements that show the amounts you wagered. If you lost money on non-casino games such as poker or blackjack, you can still claim a deduction as long as you have documentation of the amount wagered and the results of the game.

It is important to remember that gambling losses are only deductible if they exceed any winnings you had for the year. So if you won $1,000 at the casino but lost $1,500 elsewhere, you can only claim a deduction for $500.

If you have any questions about how to claim gambling losses on your state tax return, please contact an accountant or tax specialist.

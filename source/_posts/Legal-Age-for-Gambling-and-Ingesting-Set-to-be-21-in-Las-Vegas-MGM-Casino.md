#  Legal Age for Gambling and Ingesting Set to be 21 in Las Vegas MGM Casino

The Nevada Gaming Commission voted unanimously on Wednesday to approve a new regulation that will set the minimum legal age to gamble and consume alcoholic beverages at 21 years old in MGM resorts properties in Las Vegas. The regulation will also apply to other licensed gaming establishments in the state.

Chairman Tony Alamo Jr said that the commission wants to ensure that people who gamble or drink in the casinos are "of a legal age where they can make adult decisions." He added that the commission is committed to protecting Nevadans and visitors alike.

The new regulation comes into effect on 1 October this year and violators could face fines or have their gaming licences revoked. MGM has already announced that it will comply with the new regulations and raise the minimum age for gambling and drinking at its properties to 21.

This is not the first time that Nevada has raised its minimum gambling age. The state raised the minimum age from 18 to 21 in 2007. However, this is the first time that the drinking age has been raised as well. Many other US states also have a minimum legal gambling age of 21, including Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Oregon and Washington.

LAS VEGAS - Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed a bill into law on Thursday that will legalize gambling and ingesting at 21 in the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Lawmakers hope the move will help revive the state's struggling gambling and tourism industry.

"This is a major victory for our state," said Governor Sandoval. " legal gambling and ingesting at 21 in the MGM Casino will create jobs and bring much needed revenue to our state."

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased crime and social ills, but Governor Sandoval dismissed their concerns. "There is no evidence that legalizing gambling and ingesting at 21 in the MGM Casino will increase crime or social ills," he said. "In fact, I believe it will have just the opposite effect."

Governor Sandoval also said that he would be asking the Legislature to approve a measure next year that would allow gambling and ingesting at 18 in other casinos in Nevada.

#  Legal Age for Gambling, Drinking, and Smoking in Las Vegas MGM Casino Set to be 21

Las Vegas casinos are planning on changing the legal age for gambling, drinking, and smoking from 18 to 21. The move is an attempt to make the casinos more family friendly and to protect casino employees from working with underage customers.

The change will take effect starting October 1st. Casinos that don’t comply could face penalties from the state gaming commission.

This isn’t the first time that the legal age has been raised in Las Vegas. The age for drinking was raised to 21 in 2009. The smoking age was raised to 21 in 2014.

The gaming commission is also considering a proposal that would raise the minimum age for buying guns in Nevada from 18 to 21.

#  Nevada Lawmakers Approve Raising Legal Age for Gambling, Drinking, and Smoking to 21 in Las Vegas MGM Casino

In a unanimous vote on Tuesday, the Nevada Senate approved a bill that raises the minimum legal age for gambling, drinking, and smoking in MGM casino hotels from 18 to 21.

Sponsored by Republican Senator Becky Harris, the bill now heads to the desk of Governor Brian Sandoval for his signature. If signed into law, the measure will take effect on January 1, 2018.

The Las Vegas MGM resort is one of several major gaming companies that have quietly lobbied for a minimum age increase in recent years. The company has said that it wants to ensure its casinos are family-friendly destinations.

While the raised age limit will apply only to MGM properties in Nevada, it could set a precedent for other states with similar businesses.

#  Las Vegas MGM Casino Announces that the Legal Age for Gambling, Ingesting, and Smoking will be 21

The Las Vegas MGM Casino has announced that the legal age for gambling, ingesting, and smoking will all be 21. They cited the need to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for their guests as the main reason for the change.

Many people are in support of the change, but there are some who feel that it could hurt business. One mother of two who gambles said that she may not visit the casino as often because of the new age requirement.

Others, however, feel that this is a great move and that it will help to keep people safe while they are in the casino. Some experts even believe that this could set a precedent for other casinos across the country.

When it comes to gambling, there are few games as exciting and nerve-wracking as keno. This ancient Chinese lottery game has been around for centuries and continues to be a popular choice among casino-goers today. Despite its simplicity – all players have to do is choose between one and 10 numbers and wait for the results – keno can be wildly unpredictable, which is why it’s so thrilling to play.

If you’re looking for some keno excitement of your own, you’ll be happy to know that there have been plenty of big winners in the game lately. Just last week, a man walked away with $5 million after hitting the jackpot in a keno game at a casino in Las Vegas. And earlier this year, a couple playing keno at an Illinois casino hit the jackpot for over $1 million.

If you want to join these lucky winners, start by doing some research on the best keno games and casinos to play at. You can find good information on websites like Casino.org or AskGamblers.com. Then head to your nearest casino and give keno a try!

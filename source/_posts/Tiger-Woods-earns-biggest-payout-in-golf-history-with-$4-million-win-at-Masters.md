#  Tiger Woods earns biggest payout in golf history with $4 million win at Masters

In a stunning turn of events, Tiger Woods has won the Masters, earning himself the biggest payout in golf history.

Coming back from personal and professional setbacks, Woods' victory Tour has been an improbable one. After his win at the Tour Championship last year, many believed he had a chance at the Masters this year. And that's exactly what happened, as Woods came out on top in a close battle with fellow golfer Francesco Molinari.

Woods' prize for winning the Masters is $4 million, which is more than any other golfer has ever won in a single tournament. In fact, it's more than twice as much as the runner-up took home this year.

This massive payday is a testament to Woods' determination and perseverance. He has shown that he is still capable of winning on the biggest stage in golf, and his comeback is sure to inspire others who are going through tough times.

Congratulations to Tiger Woods on an amazing victory!

#  Champion Tiger Woods cashes in on whopping $1.4 million prize money

It was a triumphant return to competitive golf for Tiger Woods as he took home the $1.4 million prize money at the Tour Championship in Atlanta on Sunday.

The 43-year-old 14-time major champion ended a five-year barren spell on the PGA Tour with a two-stroke victory over Billy Horschel to cap a remarkable comeback from career-threatening injury and personal scandal.

Woods’s first prize of the season was his 80th career win on the tour, putting him in solo second place behind Sam Snead’s 82 victories.

“It feels really good,” Woods said after his win. “I’ve been waiting for this for a very long time, and I couldn’t be more excited right now. To have come this far and done this well, it feels amazing.”

But while Woods pocketed the $1.4 million winner’s check, his total earnings for the season amounted to $9 million – more than any other golfer on tour.

Woods has not won a major championship since 2008, but he will surely be among the favorites at next year’s Masters after contending in all four of the 2018 majors.

#  Woods' record-breaking payout eclipses $1 million mark for first time

In what was seen as a record-breaking payday for an individual golfer, Tiger Woods won the 2019 Masters Tournament and took home a $1.98 million prize.

The win was Woods' fifth green jacket but his first since 2005. It also marked his first victory in a major tournament in 11 years. In total, the 43-year-old has now earned over $114 million in prize money throughout his career.

While some may see Woods' latest payday as excessive, it is worth noting that the payout dwarfs the $175,000 he received for winning the 1997 Masters Tournament. In fact, it is more than three times the amount Phil Mickelson took home for winning this year's PGA Championship.

Despite his impressive winnings, Woods still falls well short of NFL quarterback Matt Ryan, who became the league's first $30 million man last year when he signed a new contract with the Atlanta Falcons.

#  Wins at Augusta National yield biggest payday of Woods' career

Tiger Woods' fifth Masters victory was also the most lucrative of his career. The $2 million first-place money payout is the largest of Woods' 24 career wins on the PGA Tour.

Woods has now won 79 PGA Tour events, and the total prize money for those victories is over $111 million. That number would be even higher if not for the golfer's self-imposed exile from competition following revelations of his extramarital affairs in 2009.

Woods has won 14 tournaments since his return to golf in late 2012, including five of the last six events he has entered. His latest victory at Augusta National makes him just the fourth player in history to win all four major championships.

In addition to the $2 million first-place check, Woods also stands to earn a healthy bonus for winning the Green Jacket. The champion of the Masters typically receives a $1 million bonus from Augusta National Golf Club, and Woods will likely collect that amount as well.

#  Tiger Woods takes home largest gambling payout in Masters Tournament history

Las Vegas, Nevada - In a stunning upset, Tiger Woods walked away from the 2018 Masters Tournament with an $1.98 million dollar prize, the largest gambling payout in the history of the event.

Woods began the tournament as a heavy underdog, but his steady play throughout the four rounds led to his first victory at Augusta National in fourteen years.

"This feels amazing," said Woods after his win. "I never thought I'd have another chance to win here, and to pull it off is just incredible."

Woods' victory capped off a remarkable comeback season for the former world number one, who had been struggling with personal problems and injuries in recent years.

"It's been a long road back," said Woods, "but to finally win again means everything to me."

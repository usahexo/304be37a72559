#  What is the legal gambling age in Las Vegas? 

The legal gambling age in Las Vegas is 21 years old. This applies to all casinos in the city, including those on the Las Vegas Strip. There are some exceptions: players can gamble at 18 years old in some bingo and keno facilities, and at Native American tribal casinos. 

The legal gambling age in Nevada has been 21 years old since 1959. The law was introduced to help reduce crime, as most of the people committing crimes were underage. It has been amended a few times over the years – for example, in 2007 it was lowered from 21 to 18 for poker and table games in licensed establishments, but raised back to 21 in 2011 – but the gambling age has always remained at 21. 

There is no national legal gambling age, so each state decides what the minimum age should be. In some states it is 18 (like in Nevada), while others have set it at 21 (like New Jersey). No states have a minimum age of 19 or 20, although there are a few with a minimum age of 23. 

It’s worth noting that just because the legal gambling age is 21 doesn’t mean that all casinos will stop players who are under this age from playing. Many casinos will allow guests younger than 21 years old to gamble if they are accompanied by an adult – usually their parents or guardian. 

If you’re looking to gamble in Las Vegas, make sure you bring your passport or driver’s license as proof of your age – you won’t be able to gamble without it!

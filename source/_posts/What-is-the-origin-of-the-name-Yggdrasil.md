#  What is the origin of the name Yggdrasil?

The name Yggdrasil has its origins in Norse mythology and is the name of the tree that connects the nine worlds in Norse cosmology.

The first mention of Yggdrasil is found in the Poetic Edda, a 13th century collection of Old Norse poems. In the poem, Rigsthula, Rig (a god or hero in early Germanic paganism) travels to three homes and fathers three sons. The third home he visits is described as follows:

There Rig saw an ash tree, Yggdrasil;
Its limbs were fair and grown with shoots;
Its boughs were high and spreading.
Rig spoke: “This tree is famed for great good;
Many a marvel is told of it.”

Later in the poem, it is mentioned that Odin, the chief god in Norse mythology, hangs himself from Yggdrasil in order to gain wisdom.


Over time, additional information about Yggdrasil was added to Norse mythology. For example, it was said that Yggdrasil was so large that its branches covered the sky and reached down to the underworld. The tree was also said to have three wells underneath it – one for water, one for milk and one for wine.

#  What is the significance of the serpent Nidhogg gnawing at the tree's roots?

In Norse mythology, the serpent Nidhogg gnaws at the tree's roots, symbolizing the destructive power of time. The tree's roots represent the past, while the branches represent the future. Nidhogg represents death and destruction, which inevitably erode the tree's foundation. This metaphor highlights the transient nature of existence and the inevitability of death.

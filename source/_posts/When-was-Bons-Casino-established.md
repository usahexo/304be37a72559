#  Who is the owner of Bons Casino?

Bayer 04 Leverkusen is a professional association football club based in the North Rhine-Westphalia city of Leverkusen. The team currently plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of German football.

The club was founded in 1904 and has grown to be one of the most successful teams in Germany, winning four Bundesliga titles and one DFB-Pokal. Bayer 04 Leverkusen also reached the final of the UEFA Champions League in 2002.

Some sources state that Bayer 04 Leverkusen does have an ownership stake in Bons Casino, while others claim that this is not the case. It seems as though there may be some affiliation between the two organizations, but it is not clear if this extends to an ownership stake.

Bayer 04 Leverkusen has not commented on this matter, so it remains unclear as to whether or not there is an ownership stake involved. This issue is likely to remain unresolved for some time until either Bayer 04 Leverkusen or Bons Casino provides clarification on the matter.

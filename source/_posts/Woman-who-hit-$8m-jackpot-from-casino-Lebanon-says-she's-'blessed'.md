#  Woman who hit $8m jackpot from casino Lebanon says she's 'blessed'

A woman from Lebanon who hit an $8 million jackpot from a casino in the country said she was "blessed." 

The 25-year-old woman, who has not been identified, said she was playing slots at the Casino du Liban when she hit the massive payout. She told reporters that she plans to use the money to buy a house and a car.

"I'm blessed. I still can't believe it," she said. "I was shaking when I saw the amount." 

Lebanon's finance minister, Ali Hassan Khalil, congratulated the woman on her win, calling it a sign of the country's improving economy. The Casino du Liban is one of the most popular gambling destinations in the Middle East, with more than 150 gaming tables and more than 1,500 slot machines.

A Lebanese woman who was visiting a casino in the Philippines has hit the jackpot, winning more than $8 million.

According to local media reports, the woman, who has not been identified, was playing at the Solaire Resort and Casino in Manila when she won the life-changing sum.

The casino said in a statement that the woman is now its "biggest cash winner ever".

She is not the only one from Lebanon to have struck it rich at a casino – back in 2010, another Lebanese national won $2.9 million at a casino in Las Vegas.

 So what is it about casinos that seems to attract people from Lebanon?

One possible explanation is that casinos offer an opportunity to make quick and easy money. In a country where opportunities to make a good wage are limited, many people may see gambling as a way to make some fast cash.

There is also a strong betting culture in Lebanon, with many people enjoying a flutter on horses or football matches. Gambling is seen as something of a national pastime, so it's no surprise that some Lebanese nationals are drawn to casinos as well.

Whatever the reason, it's clear that casinos can be very profitable for those lucky enough to win big sums of money. And with more and more casinos opening up across the world, there's always the chance that someone from Lebanon could strike it rich once again.
